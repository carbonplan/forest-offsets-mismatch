    "\n",
    "Sierra Pacific initially listed several of the boundaries we examined as separate projects. As the\n",

    "note attached to project the Martell project (CAR1409) reads: \"Project combined with CAR1386,\n",
    "CAR1404, CAR1405, and CAR1406.\" The RBS 2019 project (CAR1381) has a similar history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with provisional project boundary data has practical implications for our analysis, because\n",
    "the final project boundaries (and therefore their intersection with the VCM data) might be different\n",
    "from the data we have available. Furthermore, we have strong evidence that the data we have is\n",
    "incomplete. According to paperwork for CAR1409, total project acreage is reported at 87,266 acres.\n",
    "The total area of the four shapefiles we downloaded, however, is only 75,823 acres. In this case, it\n",
    "appears we do not have access to project boundary data for a fifth project area named \"Blue.\" We\n",
    "account for this missing data in our analysis by making the maximally conservative assumption that\n",
    "100% of the unaccounted for acreage falls within the future habitable zone of confiers in the Sierra\n",
    "Nevada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missingness also occurs in cases where a project has acreage that falls outside the study reigon of\n",
    "Hill et al., 2023. RBS 2019, for example, has at least two properties that have no intersection with\n",
    "the provided VCM data. Less than 20 percent of RBS 2019's acreage falls within the zombie forest\n",
    "study area. In these cases, we again make a maximally conservative assumption, assuming that confier\n",
    "habit will remain stable in all regions where the VCM metric was not explicitly calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, we should also note that there is a fifth project named Crane Valley (CAR1114)\n",
    "that also falls within the zombie forest study area. Like the other projects examined in this\n",
    "notebook, it is also owned by SPI. However, we excluded it from our analysis because the project\n",
    "appears to have been dormant since 2017 despite having mostly complete paperwork.\n"
